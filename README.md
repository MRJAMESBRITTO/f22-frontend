# f22 labs-frontend task
## About the task
The task given to me is to create a frontend UI from the given four designs.
I choosed the default design that is interview design.

The layout of the interview design can be divided into **three sections**.

1. The side menu tab.
2. The header section.
3. The main body part which contains cards.

## The side menu tab
It is a vertical menu tab.I got this layout from purecss website , and edited according to my need.
You can get that layout from https://purecss.io/layouts/side-menu/

## The header section
It is an ordinary header. It consists of a search box. I added the search icon from font awesome . 

## The main body part with cards
I have done this using grid concept.You can see more about grid here https://purecss.io/grids/  
I got the idea for creating cards by seeing other git repository.
The code for card goes like this
```
<div class="l-box">
<div class="card">
<div class="front">
<div class="cover">
<img class="pure-img-responsive"
src=" " alt=" ">
</div>
<div class="user">
<img src="">
</div>
<div class="card-content">
<div class="main">
```
